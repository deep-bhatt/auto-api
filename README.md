# AutoAPI

## What is AutoAPI ?

In simple words, AutoAPI takes your dataset, be it in CSV, excel, or SQL Data Export file format, and automatically creates APIs for accessing the data. You decide access control, pricing... and all the administrative actions.

## How do I know if I should use AutoAPI ?

* You have a dataset and you want to make it publically avaiable via APIs
* You want fine security control over which data is to be avaiable for access
* You want to set some pricing to monitize the data you're making accessable
* You don't want to go through the burden to setup APIs yourself
* If you check all or some of the boxes, then you can benefit from using AutoAPI
